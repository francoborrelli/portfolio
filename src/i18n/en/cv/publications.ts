  CACIC_2018_DESCRIPTION: `In this paper, the exploration of two existing beacon APIs is presented, one for PhoneGap and another for React Native. For this exploration, two mobile applications were developed, one in PhoneGap and another in React Native; both of which utilize these APIs to detect proximity to beacons. Upon entering the proximity of a beacon, the information of the beacon is displayed on the screen. Different characteristics of these developed applications are detailed, with emphasis on the comparative analysis of these developments regarding what each API provides. Additionally, the work presents a discussion space to analyze the lessons learned in the conducted exploration, aiming to contribute to the theme related to the development of such applications.`,

//   ENFOQUE_UTE_2019_DESCRIPTION: `The contribution of this paper is to explore how to approach in-situ co-design experiences of Mobile Games based on Positioning in enclosed spaces (for example: a building), describing the lessons learned on this topic. This work presents a conceptual framework for in-situ co-design of Mobile Games based on Positioning for enclosed spaces, aiming to assist facilitators in addressing such experiences with useful resources (e.g., Design Thinking resources). Using this framework, an in-situ co-design experience of a Mobile Game based on Positioning in an enclosed space is presented; for some stages, an authoring tool was used to co-design in-situ which places are relevant for an application. Based on this experience, the authoring tool was extended to create a particular type of Mobile Game based on Positioning. This paper presents this extension along with a proof of concept demonstrating how a co-designed game in-situ with this extension was used by end-users.`,

  INCISCOS_2019_DESCRIPTION: `Location-based Mobile Games have been growing in popularity in recent years. But these are widely explored only for outdoor spaces, since it has the advantage of using GPS data to obtain the user's current location. There is no unified solution to sense the user’s location in indoor spaces; so, games for these spaces are little explored. The design of Location-based Mobile Games, in many cases, requires the participation of multidisciplinary teams; so, they are co-designed by a group of people. However, there is no clear way of knowing how this codesign should be conducted. The aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework for in-situ co-design for indoor spaces on Location-based Mobile Games through the use of Design Thinking's resources. This conceptual framework could help facilitators with this kind of experience to consider what resources can be useful to this task. An experience of in-situ co-design of a Location-based Mobile Game for indoor spaces is presented using the proposed framework. In addition, a discussion is generated in relation to this kind of co-design.`,

  ENFOQUE_UTE_2020_DESCRIPTION: `The contribution of this paper is to explore how in-situ co-design of indoor spaces (e.g. building) of Location-based Mobile Games could be handle, by describing the learned lessons on this topic. This paper presents a conceptual framework for in-situ co-design of indoor spaces on Location-based Mobile Games to assist to carry out this kind of experience using useful resources (as Design Thinking’s resources). An experience of in-situ co-design for an indoor space on a Locationbased Mobile Game is presented using this framework; for some phases an authoring tool was used which allows in-situ co-design of relevant locations for an application. Based on this experience, the authoring tool was extended to create a specific kind of Location-based Mobile Game. This paper presents this extension along with a proof of concept that shows how an in-situ co-designed game created by this extension was used by end-users.`,

    'In-situ co-design and creation of mobile games based on positioning in indoor spaces',

  THESIS_SYSTEMS_LENGTH: '2021',
  THESIS_SYSTEMS_DESCRIPTION: `Bachelor's thesis in Systems Engineering. The popularity of Location-based Mobile Games has grown in recent years. Designing this type of game is a complex task since, in addition to addressing the specific characteristics of each game, aspects such as user positioning must be considered. This task becomes even more complex when it comes to mobile games for indoor spaces since there is no unified criterion on what the best positioning strategy is. In line with this complexity, this work presents an authoring tool to support the in-situ co-design of this type of games, particularly in enclosed spaces. This tool provides the possibility of having mobile games functioning after the co-design stage.`,

  JAIIO_2021_LENGTH: '2021',
  JAIIO_2021_DESCRIPTION: `The paper with distributed teams has been increasing in recent years. However, the pandemic situation caused many work teams accustomed to in-person co-design experiences to quickly transition to distributed virtual co-design, thus generating different challenges and impacting the approach. This paper presents an authoring tool that allows for the distributed co-design of location-based mobile games in indoor spaces. Additionally, a conceptual framework for co-designing this type of games is defined, which combines the authoring tool with Design Thinking resources. Using this framework, two distributed co-design experiences are described, which allow exploring different ways of using the same software artifact in different co-design approaches. Likewise, a discussion space is presented with some lessons learned and reflections on the topic.`,

  SADIO_2022_DESCRIPTION: `The work with distributed teams has been increasing more and more in recent years. However, the pandemic situation caused many work teams accustomed to in-person co-design experiences to quickly transition to distributed virtual co-design, thus generating different challenges and impacting the way problems were being approached. This paper presents an authoring tool that allows for the distributed co-design of location-based mobile games in indoor spaces. Additionally, a conceptual framework for co-designing this type of games is defined, which allows combining the authoring tool with Design Thinking resources. Using this framework, three experiences of distributed co-design with synchronous and asynchronous activities are described, which allow exploring different ways of using software artifacts in co-design approaches. Likewise, a discussion space is presented with some lessons learned and reflections on the topic.`,

  CC_BB_ET_2023_DESCRIPTION: `Sentiment analysis is a process of identifying and extracting personal information from textual data. It has become essential for businesses and organizations to understand customers' opinions, emotions, and attitudes toward their products, services, or brands. While creating a custom sentiment analysis model can provide tailored results for specific datasets, it can also be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and require a high level of expertise in machine learning. Some tools offer a faster and more accessible alternative to users without a background in machine learning to create a custom model. However, researchers and practitioners usually do not know how to choose the best tool for each domain. This paper compares and evaluates some sentiment analysis tools' differences, considering how they were built and how suitable they are for analyzing sentiments on some specific topics. In particular, this paper focuses on four popular sentiment analysis tools for Python: TextBlob, Vader, Flair, and HuggingFace Transformers.`,
