But these are widely explored only for outdoor spaces, since it has the advantage of using GPS data to obtain the user's current location. There is no unified solution to sense the user’s location in indoor spaces; so, games for these spaces are little explored. The design of Location-based Mobile Games, in many cases, requires the participation of multidisciplinary teams; so, they are co-designed by a group of people. However, there is no clear way of knowing how this codesign should be conducted. The aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework for in-situ co-design for indoor spaces on Location-based Mobile Games through the use of Design Thinking's resources. This conceptual framework could help facilitators with this kind of experience to consider what resources can be useful to this task. An experience of in-situ co-design of a Location-based Mobile Game for indoor spaces is presented using the proposed framework. In addition, a discussion is generated in relation to this kind of co-design.`,

It has become essential for businesses and organizations to understand customers' opinions, emotions, and attitudes toward their products, services, or brands. While creating a custom sentiment analysis model can provide tailored results for specific datasets, it can also be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and require a high level of expertise in machine learning. Some tools offer a faster and more accessible alternative to users without a background in machine learning to create a custom model. However, researchers and practitioners usually do not know how to choose the best tool for each domain. This paper compares and evaluates some sentiment analysis tools' differences, considering how they were built and how suitable they are for analyzing sentiments on some specific topics. In particular, this paper focuses on four popular sentiment analysis tools for Python: TextBlob, Vader, Flair, and HuggingFace Transformers.`,
